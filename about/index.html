<p class="subheading">About these tutorials</p>
<p>
Welcome!
</p>
<p>
Here is how these tutorials work:
</p>
<p>
First there is a download link to the complete game, and a description of the rules and controls of the game. I recommend playing the game before moving on to the next steps so you can have a good understanding of what the game does.
</p>
<p>
Then there is a basic overview of the game's data and logic, like how you might think through how you're going to approach programming the game before you begin coding.
</p>
<p>
Then the code is built up step-by-step. This includes intermediary steps that don't appear in the final code but help us get there. I recommend following along in your own code editor and running the code after ever step.
</p>

<p>
Because these tutorials are for beginners, the games that these tutorials make are small and simple, and the code tries to avoid anything that isn't fundamental to doing what it needs to do, so there is no object-oriented design, or code split between multiple files, etc. Less fundamental language/API features are also avoided.
</p>
<p>
To keep a level of clarity to the code, a couple of principles are followed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a value is used more than once it is generally made into a variable, and when code is used more than once it is generally made into a function.
</li>
<li>
Variables and functions are generally declared as close to the other code that uses them as possible, and if possible are local to the scope that uses them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can do these tutorials in any order. I recommend experimenting with the code, adding new things to the games, and using ideas that you've seen to create games of your own.
</p>
<p>
These tutorials are public domain, please do whatever you want with them.

I hope you have fun going through these tutorials!
